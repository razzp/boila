# boila
A small CLI utility for quickly generating HTML5 boilerplates.

## Installation
```shell
npm i -g boila
```

Boila will ask you a few questions, making some intelligent suggestions along the way, and then generate your boilerplate. If you'd like you can then export the boilerplate or copy it to the clipboard.
